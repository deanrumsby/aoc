Question

## Part 1

We need to calculate the total distance between the two lists.

To do so, we first need to parse our input into two lists (arrays), so that we can order them correctly.

For each line we need a function that extracts the location IDs.
I've used regex to capture all the numbers as strings, which we can then parse into the number type.

::function-preview{mod="2024/1" fn="pluckLocationIds" :params='[{ "label": "line", "type": "text"}]'}
#definition
```typescript
type LocationId = number

function pluckLocationIds(line: string): LocationId[] {
  return line
    .match(/\d+/g)
    ?.map(n => parseInt(n, 10))
}
```
::

Now we will split our given input into its two separate lists by iterating over each line
and utilising our `pluckLocationIds` function. 


::function-preview{mod="2024/1" fn="parseLists" :params='[{ "label": "input", "type": "textarea"}]'}
#definition
```typescript
function parseLists(input: string): [LocationId[], LocationId[]] {
  const lists: [LocationId[], LocationId[]] = [[], []]
  const lines = input.split('\n')

  for (const line of lines) {
    const [left, right] = pluckLocationIds(line)
    lists[0].push(left)
    lists[1].push(right)
  }

  return lists
}
```
::

To find the total distance we have to sort the lists in ascending order and then take the (positive) difference between the pairs of numbers. 
We can create a function to calculate the distance of a single pair of numbers first.

::function-preview{mod="2024/1" fn="calculateDistanceBetweenLocationIds" :params='[{ "label": "a", "type": "number" }, { "label": "b", "type": "number"}]'}
#definition
```typescript
function calculateDistanceBetweenLocationIds(a: LocationId, b: LocationId): number {
  return Math.abs(a - b)
}
```
::

Followed by the implementation that sums across the two ordered lists, completing our solution for part 1.

::function-preview{mod="2024/1" fn="part1" :params='[{ "label": "input", "type": "textarea" }]'}
#definition
```typescript
function calculateTotalDistanceBetweenLists(left: LocationId[], right: LocationId[]): number {
  if (left.length !== right.length) return null

  const sortedLeft = left.sort()
  const sortedRight = right.sort()

  let distance = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < left.length; i++) {
    distance += calculateDistanceBetweenLocationIds(sortedLeft[i], sortedRight[i])
  }
  return distance
}

function part1(input: string): number {
  const [left, right] = parseLists(input)
  return calculateTotalDistanceBetweenLists(left, right)
}
```
::

## Part 2

We have been asked to calculate the similarity score between the two lists. This just becomes another function.

::function-preview{mod="2024/1" fn="part2" :params='[{ "label": "input", "type": "textarea" }]'}
#definition
```typescript
function calculateSimilarityScore(left: LocationId[], right: LocationId[]): number {
  let score = 0
  for (const leftId of left) {
    const rightCount = right.filter(rightId => rightId === leftId).length
    score += (leftId * rightCount)
  }
  return score
}

function part2(input: string): number {
  const [left, right] = parseLists(input)
  return calculateSimilarityScore(left, right)
}
```
::

The algorithm could be improved here by adding a lookup cache, as the `rightCount` variable may be computing the same value many times.
However this implementation works instantaneously so I have not decided to add this in.
